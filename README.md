# SIMPLE MAP APP

The simplest possible map app.

1.  The user opens the app.

2.  It displays the current location of the user on a map.

3.  This differs from the default behaviour of well-known map apps (Google, Apple etc.) in two ways:

             i) the display opens zoomed in on the user's location and immediate surroundings;
             ii) there is no map clutter, no markings of any kind. Just the basic street display with buildings etc.

4.  This has potential to be built upon in the future, with the addition of features configurable by the user. For now, Steps 1-3 above are the sole vision.
